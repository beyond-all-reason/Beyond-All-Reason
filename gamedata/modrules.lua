		allowCrushingAlliedUnits = true,	-- default: false.  Can allied ground units crush each other during collisions? Units still have to be explicitly set as crushable using the crushable parameter of Spring.SetUnitBlocking.
		allowGroundUnitGravity = false,		-- default: true.   Allows fast moving mobile units to 'catch air' as they move over terrain.
		--NOTE: allowGroundUnitGravity was set to false to "Fix units flying over hills and bumps", but this came at a cost for unit impulse which was a desired trait
		--allowGroundUnitGravity = true, is possibly causing units getting stuck in labs

		pfRepathMaxRateInFrames = 150,	-- default: 150.  Controls the minimum amount of frames that must pass before a unit is allowed to request a new path. Mostly for rate limiting and prevent excessive CPU wastage
		pfUpdateRateScale = 1,			-- default: 1.  Multiplier for the update rate
		pfRawMoveSpeedThreshold = 0,	-- default: 0.  Controls the speed modifier (which includes typemap boosts and up/down hill modifiers) under which units will never do raw move, regardless of distance etc. Defaults to 0, which means units will not try to raw-move into unpathable terrain (e.g. typemapped lava, cliffs, water). You can set it to some positive value to make them avoid pathable but very slow terrain (for example if you set it to 0.2 then they will not raw-move across terrain where they move at 20% speed or less, and will use normal pathing instead - which may still end up taking them through that path).
		pfHcostMult = 0.2,				-- default: 0.2.  A float value between 0 and 2. Controls how aggressively the pathing search prioritizes nodes going in the direction of the goal. Higher values mean pathing is cheaper, but can start producing degenerate paths where the unit goes straight at the goal and then has to hug a wall.
