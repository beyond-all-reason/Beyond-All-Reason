# AI Usage Policy  

## Disclosure requirements

**AI usage in generating code must be explicitly disclosed in the associated Pull Request.**  
Contributors must clearly state:
- which AI tool(s) were used (for example: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)
- the extent to which the contribution was AI-assisted

**Undisclosed AI usage will result in closure.**  
If maintainers reasonably suspect undisclosed AI use, the pull request will be closed.

**Non-direct AI usage does not require disclosure.**  
The above requirements apply to cases where AI is used to write production code.  
If AI is used solely as an advisory or educational tool, disclosure is not required.

## Verification and testing

**All AI-assisted code must be fully verified by a human contributor.**  
Contributors are responsible for ensuring that:
- the code has been run and tested
- the code behaves correctly in practice, not just in theory

It is recommended to attach test artifacts, such as screenshots or recordings, that demonstrate your code working for each test step.

## Issues and discussions

**AI assistance is permitted in issues and discussions, with a strict human-in-the-loop requirement:**

- AI-generated content must be reviewed and edited by a human before submission.
- Verbosity, noise, and speculative content must be removed.
- Contributors remain responsible for research, accuracy, and clarity.

AI may assist with explanations, summaries, or drafting, but must not replace understanding or judgment.

## Prohibited content

**AI-generated media is not permitted.**  
This includes, but is not limited to: art, images, videos, and audio.  
Only text and code are eligible for AI assistance, subject to the rules above.

## Enforcement

**Repeated or intentional misuse of AI tools may result in contributor bans.**  
Maintainers may enforce this policy at their discretion.

## Why is this important?

Beyond All Reason is maintained by humans.

Every issue, discussion, and pull request is read and reviewed by maintainers who volunteer their time and expertise. Submitting low-effort, unverified, or poorly understood work shifts the burden of validation onto maintainers and is considered disrespectful of that effort.

The primary behavior this policy seeks to prevent is **Vibe Coding**, defined as the uncritical generation and submission of AI-produced code without sufficient understanding, verification, or accountability by the contributor. This policy exists to prevent wasted maintainer time and to ensure high standards of code quality and maintainability.

This policy exists to protect maintainers, preserve code quality, and ensure that collaboration remains productive and sustainable.

## Responsible AI usage is welcome

Beyond All Reason maintainers actively use AI tools as part of their workflow. 
This policy does not represent an anti-AI position.

The restrictions outlined above exist due to repeated misuse of AI by contributors who submit unverified, low-quality, or poorly understood work. The issue is not the tools themselves, but how they are applied.

When used responsibly, transparently, and with proper human oversight, AI can be a valuable productivity aid.
