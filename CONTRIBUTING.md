# Contributing to Beyond All Reason (BAR)

## AI Assistance Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to BAR,
> it must be disclosed in the pull request.

Disclose the usage, along with the extent to
which AI assistance was used (e.g. docs only vs. code generation).
If PR responses are being generated by an AI, disclose that as well.

An example disclosure:

> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.

Or a more detailed disclosure:

> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution
> was fully authored manually by myself.

In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality
work than any human. That isn't the world we live in today, and in most cases
it's generating slop.

When using AI assistance, we expect contributors to understand the code
that is produced and be able to answer critical questions about it. In the
end, you are responsible for all code you submit.

Please be respectful to maintainers and disclose AI assistance.
