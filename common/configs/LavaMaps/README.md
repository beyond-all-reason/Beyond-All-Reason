### Lava Map Configuration Directory

Place map specific lava configuration files here.

Note the lava configuration can also be included inside the map pack in mapconfig/lava.lua (recommmended).

The mapconfig has precedence over game provided configuration, but overrideMap can be set to true inside the file here to make it have priority.

The game will try to find the full name with version, like "Ghenna Rising 4.0.1.lua", if not found then it will search for a configuration without the version "Ghenna Rising.lua".

### Note for map makers

You can just take a file from here and place it inside mapconfig/lava.lua for your map to have lava.
