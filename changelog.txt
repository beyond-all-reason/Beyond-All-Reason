• [Mauser + Quaker] Rework from proposed_unit_reworks modoption moved to main game with a few additional changes.  This rework aims to give these units a more mobile and aggressive role, which reduces the role overlap with the heavier T2 veh artillery options.  Their ranges are reduced by 120, speed increased by 20%, acceleration increased 50%, health increased 20%, and accuracy is improved.  
• [Stiletto] Rework from proposed_unit_reworks modoption moved to main game.

# November 2023
• [Release Candidate Modoption] Dragon rework is added to the list of units in the release candidates modoption.  This updates the dragon model and changes its weapons.  An anti-air turret is added so that the unit can deal with small amounts of T1 fighters, the front weapon is changed from a laser to a flamethrower, and the side turrets have been split from 2 medium to 4 smaller laser turrets.  
• [Consul] Recluse removed from build list, Webber added to build list.

 • [RFLRPC] Ragnarok now correctly has a 0.4 reload time at 0 XP. Both Ragnarok and Calamity have animations tied to XP gain, so they properly animate faster and gain firerate increases with XP gains. 


Other

 • [Thor] EMP rocket now launches immediately. To compensate, overall missile flight time increased by 2.5 seconds. Model animation now reveals to opponent how many EMP missiles are loaded.
