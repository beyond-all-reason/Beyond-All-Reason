# January 2025
• [Artillery] The High/Low Trajectory toggle has been removed and been automated. Both modes now share the same damage and AOE. Aiming low is preferred, but if there's no low trajectory targets in range  or the manually selected target cannot be shot with low trajectory, high trajectory will be used instead for a short time.
	The following units are affected:
	- [Gauntlet] (T1 Plasma Artillery Turret)
	- [Agitator] (T1 Plasma Artillery Turret)
	- [Rattlesnake] (T2 Plasma Popup Artillery)
	- [Persecutor] (T2 Plasma Popup Artillery)
	- [Vanguard] (T3 Mobile All-Terrain Artillery)
• [Angler] The T2 Cortex torpedo bomber now drops 1 large torpedo instead of 3 small ones.  The large torpedo is slightly slower but has some aoe  
• [Serpent] The Arm T2 battlesub now fires 2 medium torpedos at once instead of 1 large one, overall dps unchanged but some aoe is added
• [Kraken] The Cor T2 battlesub's torpedo aoe increased

• [New units] Heavy T1 air transport for arm (Osprey) and for cor (Hephastus) moved to the basegame.  These transports can carry the same weight as T2 transports but at a lower movespeed, and are able to transport the commander.  Osprey costs 190m 4000E, has 110 speed, and 630 health.  Hephaestus costs 190m 4000E, has 100 speed, and 800 health.  
• [Stork/Hercules] T1 light air transports no longer able to transport the commander, and can now only carry units below 750 metal.  Energy/metal/buildcost reverted to earlier values (68m 1300E 3850bp for Stork and 74m 1450E 4120bp for Hercules)

# August 2024
• [Tremor] firemodes unified to remove the toggle, and effective DPS in target area increased. Wasp bugfixed, and now has mild tracking on rockets, so will miss shots less often.
• [Dragon Claw/Maw] Collision volume and aim position will now change when the units open up, so it can be targeted when behind a wall

# July 2024
• [Minelayers] Minelayers now live up to the 'minesweeper' role properly, being able to detect enemy mines within 450 radius, and slowly clear them, with a moderate ranged weapon.
• [Naval Economy Buildings] Stats made equal to land versions. Specifically, T1 and T2 Energy Convertors, Energy and Metal Storages, and the T2 mex have been harmonised for both Core and Arm.
• [Salamander] Energy cost increased 4775->7000 to make the unit more difficult to rush early on and put its cost more in line with other amphibs (energy being 20x metal cost).  Range reduced from 360->340 to make it slightly more difficult to kite T1 units and commanders.  
• [Whistler + Lasher] Ground range increased by 25 (525/550->550/575 range)

• [Mauser + Quaker] Rework from proposed_unit_reworks modoption moved to main game with a few additional changes.  This rework aims to give these units a more mobile and aggressive role, which reduces the role overlap with the heavier T2 veh artillery options.  Their ranges are reduced by 120, speed increased by 20%, acceleration increased 50%, health increased 20%, and accuracy is improved.  
• [Stiletto] Rework from proposed_unit_reworks modoption moved to main game.
