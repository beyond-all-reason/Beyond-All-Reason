	When cardinal locking is disabled, the camera's ry (y rotation in radians) is treated literally.
	In this case, simply adding (or subtracting) pi from the ry correctly flips the camera by 180 degrees.

	When cardinal locking is enabled, the camera's ry is interpolated to keep a small part of the
	range near each of the four cardinal directions "sticky" to the cardinal direction.

	However, the interpolation formula has problematic behavior when ry is near zero.
	This requires two adjustments:

	1. Adding pi always works when the initial ry is positive, and subtracting pi
	always works when the initial ry is negative. This avoids crossing 0, which
	would cause issues.
	2. When the initial ry is between (-0.1)halfpi and (0.1)halfpi, adding
	or subtracting pi does not generate a full 180 degree rotation. A small
	correction is necessary to increase the rotation to 180 degrees.

	The interpolation formula is at `static float GetRotationWithCardinalLock(float rot)`
	in `SpringController.cpp`
