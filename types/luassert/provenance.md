# Provenance: Luassert Type Definitions

These type definitions were copied for local type-checking support, as part of
the Busted testing framework’s dependency chain. They are used only for static
analysis, not runtime inclusion.

Luassert type definitions are distributed under the same MIT license as Busted.

Note: The LuaCATS/luassert repository does not include an explicit LICENSE file,
but the upstream implementation (https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/luassert) is
licensed under MIT, and is distributed through Busted (also MIT). These type
definitions are considered covered under the same terms.
